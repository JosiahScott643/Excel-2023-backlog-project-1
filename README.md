<h1>Sales Data Visualization in Excel</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The **Sales Data Visualization** project involved analyzing a large database of sales data and presenting the results in a visual format. The goal was to display the sales data per quarter in the form of a bar graph, as well as present monthly sales and quantity data. By using Excel's powerful PivotTables and PivotCharts, I was able to generate line and bar graphs that offered clear visual representations of the data.

The project demonstrates my ability to work with large datasets, create dynamic reports, and visually present complex data in a user-friendly manner using Excelâ€™s data analysis tools.

<h2>Tools and Features Used</h2>

- <b>Microsoft Excel</b>
- <b>PivotTables</b> (for summarizing the sales data)
- <b>PivotCharts</b> (for visual representation of data)
- <b>Bar Graphs</b> (for displaying sales per quarter)
- <b>Line Graphs</b> (for visualizing monthly sales and quantities)
- <b>Excel Functions</b> (for data manipulation and summarization)

<h2>Program Walk-through</h2>

1. **Import Data**:
   - I started by importing the provided database into Excel, ensuring all data was organized and correctly formatted for analysis.

2. **Create PivotTables**:
   - I used PivotTables to summarize the sales data, grouping it by quarters and months. The PivotTable allowed for easy filtering and summarization of sales and quantity data.

3. **Generate PivotCharts**:
   - After creating the PivotTables, I inserted PivotCharts to visually display the data. 
     - A **bar graph** was used to show sales per quarter.
     - **Line graphs** were used to represent sales and quantity per month.

4. **Adjust Chart Formats**:
   - I customized the appearance of the PivotCharts to ensure clarity, adjusting axis labels, titles, and legends for better interpretation of the data.

5. **Analyze Trends**:
   - By analyzing the graphs, I was able to identify patterns in sales performance and product quantities over time, which provided valuable insights into the business.

<h2>Example of PivotChart Usage</h2>

1. **Sales per Quarter (Bar Graph)**:
   - The PivotTable summarized total sales for each quarter, and a bar graph was used to present this information. Each bar represented the total sales for a specific quarter, making it easy to compare performance across quarters.

2. **Sales and Quantity per Month (Line Graph)**:
   - A PivotTable was created to summarize monthly sales and quantities sold. This data was visualized using line graphs, where one line represented sales and the other represented quantities sold, allowing for comparison over the months.
